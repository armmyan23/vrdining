# Dining in VR Tumo Workshop Repo
http://courses.haigarmen.com/vrdining/

This design workshop explores the way in which physical places may intersect, digitally. VR seems the obvious platform for an immersion of this sort, however designing for specific (yet broadly geographic) intersections (for example, the Armenian diaspora) would seem to require a closer analysis of our relationship (the “viewer”’s relationship, that is) to place and perspective.

This two week design seminar focuses on a theory of place in the 21st century met with an approach to designing meaningful immersive, digital experiences. Students will select local and (globally) remote sites that they want to connect in the context of the Armenian diaspora and create physical-virtual experiences to achieve this end. For example, a public park in Yerevan may have affinitive physical, emotional, cultural, digital or even aural touchpoints with a street corner in East Hollywood, CA.

Although this workshop is primarily a UX workshop about social VR spaces we will be prototyping our experiences using (https://aframe.io "A-frame") and (https://github.com/networked-aframe/networked-aframe "Networked Aframe")
